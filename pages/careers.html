          Engineering
        </h2>
        <p class="card_text">
          My primary career path is engineering, mostly due to my aptitude for math and problem solving. Saying that, I
          do have a couple things I would rather do, if they take off.

        <h2>
          Podcasting
        </h2>
        <p class="card_text">
          As mentioned on the Home page, I host a podcast. If this takes off (unlikely), I might end up monetizing it,
          and possibly going full time, if it makes enough money. Regardless of how much it makes, I intend to continue
          posting, so long as I have the time.

      <div class="card">
        <h2>
          Software Design
        </h2>
        <p class="card_text">
          Due to my interest in computers and love of problem solving, I am considering a possible future in software
          development. I am also decent at problem solving, which could prove advantageous in this field. I don't really
          want to do it full time, but if that's what I have to do to pay the rent, I'm willing
          to try it as a main career.

        <h2>
          Writing
        </h2>
        <p class="card_text">
          I've always loved writing. I'm not very good at it, but I have always enjoyed putting my various, random
          thoughts on a page. I've always hoped my english teachers would assign essays, as opposed to poorly made
          grammar assignments. I would much rather have the creative freedom to talk about a topic than take ten minutes
          to fill out an assignment that "should've" taken a half hour.
